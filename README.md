# Fourier Analogue-in-Digital

## Project Overview

It was developed as part of Project Archivist with the goal of keeping analogue signals in digital. More information can be found in the [Notion](https://mikhael-openworkspace.notion.site/Project-Archivist-e512fa7a21474ef6bdbd615a424293cf).

Note: The purpose of an archive is always to make it easy for you to access important data. Please be sure to back up any important audio files.

## How to install

1. Download the Git zip
2. Install Python (3.11^)
3. Execute install.sh
4. Restart shell with source ~/.*shrc

Installation is still only supported on Unix-like OS.

## How to use

Encoding

```bash
fourier encode "path/to/audio.flac" \
--bits 32 \                                        # Bit depth
\  # Optional
--output "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad" \          # Output file
--samples_per_block 2048 \                         # Samples per block
--enable_ecc \                                     # ECC enabled or not
--data_ecc_size 128 20 \                           # Sizes of data block and ECC block when ECC enabled
--metadata "Metadata Title" "Metadata contents" \  # Metadata
--jsonmeta "path/to/metadata.json" \               # Metadata json, will override --metadata.
--image "path/to/image/file" \                     # Image file
--verbose
```

Decoding

```bash
fourier decode "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad" \
\  # Optional
--bits 32 \                      # Bit depth for lossless compression codecs (supports 8, 16, 32)
--enable_ecc \                   # ECC verification or not
--output "path/for/audio.aac" \  # Output file
--codec "codec" \                # Codec type
--quality "320000c" \            # Quailty factor for lossy compression codecs (example is constant 320 kbps)
--verbose
```

Playback

```bash
fourier play "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad" \
\  # Optional
--key keys \     # Playback keys
--speed speed \  # Playback speed
--enable_ecc \   # ECC verification or not
--verbose
```

Edit metadata

```bash
fourier meta-modify "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad" \
\  # Optional
--metadata "Metadata Title" "Metadata contents" \  # Metadata
--jsonmeta "path/to/metadata.json" \               # Metadata json, will override --metadata.
--image "path/to/image/file" \                     # Image file
```

Extract metadata

```bash
fourier parse "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad"
```

ECC packing/repacking

```bash
fourier ecc "path/to/fourierAnalogue.frad" \
\  # Optional
--verbose
```

Example of .json file is in Example folder.
