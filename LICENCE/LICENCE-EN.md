V1.3 - 2024. 4. 19., Original Repository

## Definition of Terms

"Work" means the entirety of the Fourier Analogue-in-Digital, including the Git repository, source code, documentation, and materials.

"Original Author" means Ha×žuL, the original initiator and primary maintainer of the Fourier Analogue-in-Digital project.

"Contributor" means any person or entity who has contributed to the Work in any form, including by raising issues or modifying the source code.

"End-Consumer Product" means an end product, such as physical or electronic goods or services, that reaches the end consumer via Fourier Analogue-in-Digital.

"Source Distribution" means distribution through distribution channels other than the repositories specified in the Official Documentation without modification of the source code.

"Reimplementation" means re-creating this Work in a different language to perform the same behaviour.

## Coverage

This licence applies to the Work as a whole, plus the copyright in Fourier Analogue-in-Digital, etc.

## Warranty

Fourier Analogue-in-Digital (hereinafter FrAD) is distributed as is.

Any repository implementing FrAD MUST be fully compatible with the [official FrAD format document](https://mikhael-openworkspace.notion.site/Format-specs-727affae8db043f2b50372d91d534368?pvs=4).

## About Redistribution or Reimplementation

When redistributing or reimplementing FrAD, the following must be observed.

### Common provisions

- There is no obligation to release source code, but it is recommended unless it is utilised as part of commercial software or contains patent-protected technology.
- If you reimplement it as open source, you must use this licence as is, but you can add attribution to the author.

### Distribution

- You cannot charge end consumers any royalties for distributing this repository, its source code, or official documentation.

### Reimplementation

- Contributors or third-party developers are welcome to create software compatible with FrAD and use it for any purpose, non-commercial or commercial. The original author does not require any royalties for this.
- The original author reserves the right to certify compliance with the FrAD format and may, in some cases, request the source code.
- After the source code has been reviewed, and at the request of the developer, the original author must destroy any source code stored on the original author's device without delay.

## About Contributions

Contributors have moral rights to their contributions and have the same rights as the original author. Contributions automatically constitute acceptance of the rights and obligations under this licence.

## Intellectual Property Rights

FrAD is without intellectual property rights. However, if you develop and implement add-ons or plug-ins, you retain independent intellectual property rights in such implementations.

## Licence Violations

After confirming that one of the conditions below has been met, the original author will notify the user of the violation and will request it to be resolved. The grace period is three periods of one month each, totalling three months.

1. Standalone commercial use of this repository without any enhancements is prohibited. Honestly, even the craziest of crazies wouldn't buy some grotesque source that might have malware instead of the official public repository, but it's prohibited anyway. It's a death penalty.
2. You are not required to credit the original author of the project. However, it is prohibited for third parties who have not contributed to the project to claim that they are the copyright holder of the project. If you have contributed, you may list the original author and the names of the contributors.
3. You may not claim any patent or trademark rights on the core technology of this project, the discrete cosine transform.
4. Commercial use of FrAD's official documents is strictly prohibited. All official documents must be distributed free of charge and made accessible to all consumers.
5. The application of copyright protection to end-consumer products is strictly prohibited. It is unacceptable to apply technologies that infringe on the legitimate rights of consumers in the name of copyright protection to FrAD, a format that is open to all.

If the violation is not resolved and the grace period has elapsed, the user will be immediately listed on FrAD's blacklist and the original author will notify them of the blacklisting.

Once blacklisted, the user will lose all access to FrAD. This includes, but is not limited to, viewing, distributing, or selling end-consumer products that are in violation of the licence, encoders, decoders, etc.

Continued use of FrAD without resolving the violation will be considered a massive infringement of moral rights and may result in immediate legal action.

### Unblacklisting

Once you fix the licence violation and pass the unblacklisting review, you will be immediately removed from the FrAD blacklist.

## Disclaimer

The original author and contributors are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages resulting from the use of this work. In fact, they cannot be liable even if they wanted to be.

## Priority between licence languages

In case of a dispute between the original author and the consumer, or any violation of the licence by the consumer, the licence in the consumer's native language or a representative equivalent of it shall take priority. However, in the event of a dispute between consumers, and if there is a conflict between the licences or their interpretation, the Korean licence shall take priority.
