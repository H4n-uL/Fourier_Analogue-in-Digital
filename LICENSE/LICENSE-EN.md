## Licence Violations

You will be listed on FrAD blacklist after 1 month of any of the following conditions.

1. Standalone commercial use of this repository without any enhancements is prohibited. Honestly, even the craziest of crazies wouldn't buy some grotesque source that might have malware instead of the official public repository, but it's prohibited anyway. It's a death penalty.
2. You are not required to credit the original author of the project. However, it is prohibited for third parties who have not contributed to the project to claim that they are the copyright holder of the project. If you have contributed, you may list the original author and the names of the contributors.
3. You may not claim any patent or trademark rights on the core technology of this project, the discrete cosine transform.
4. Commercial use of FrAD's official documents is strictly prohibited. All official documents must be distributed free of charge and made accessible to all consumers.
5. The application of copyright protection to end-consumer products is strictly prohibited. It is unacceptable to apply technologies that infringe on the legitimate rights of consumers in the name of copyright protection to FrAD, a format that is open to all.

1. After identifying a licence violation, the original author notifies the user of the violation and requests that it be resolved.
2. If the user does not resolve the violation within one month of receiving the request, the user will be immediately listed on FrAD blacklist. If the user continues to use FrAD without resolving the violation, it will be considered a massive infringement of moral rights and corresponding legal action may be taken.

### Unblacklisting

If you have lost access due to the above provision and you satisfy one of the following conditions, you will be immediately removed from the FrAD blacklist.

1. the moment you correct the licence violation and pass the licence inspection
2. 5 years have passed without using FrAD.

## Disclaimer

## Priority between licence languages

The licence in the language spoken by the end consumer takes priority. However, if there is a conflict between licences, the Korean licence will take precedence.
